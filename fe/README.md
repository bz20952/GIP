# Finite Element (FE) model
This directory contains files necessary to obtain analytical solutions in the frequency-domain, synthesise time-domain data and plot the results for a four-element FE model which approximately models the physical test specimen.

The beam.py file contains the FE model itself as well as functionality to calculate frequency response and solve the ODE to obtain time-domain solutions for various excitation methods. Time-domain data can be generated by specifying simulation parameters and passing them to the simulate function in beam.py.

The smoa.py file contains functionality to calculate second moment of area of different beam cross-sections.

The vals.py file contains constants related to the geometric and material properties of the test specimen.

The plot.py file contains plotting functionality for time-domain data, DFT, Bode and Nyquist.
