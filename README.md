Software tools developed as part of a project to design a demo rig as an educational tool for undergraduate engineers studying dynamics.

The 'gle' directory contains source code for the frontend and backend containers available as packages in this repository.

The 'fe' directory contains an FE model for the test specimen.

The 'signal_generator' directory contains a script 'run_test.py' which starts recording data, sends the audio signal to the shaker and then stops recording after a defined time period. Functionality to live plot the acceleration and force induced on the specimen while the test is running is a WIP.
